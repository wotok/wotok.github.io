### Topics of Interest

TBD
<!--0 For NLP models to be usable in practice, particularly in emerging scenarios with widely varying use cases, situations, and user expectations, there is a need to develop models that can be tailored to different consumers (individuals, groups, or organizations) and easily controlled by them; models that can reason about their users’ (often private) knowledge and context to provide personalized responses. The topics of this workshop include (but not limited to):

* __Data__: Data collection, processing, analysis, and annotation efforts to increase representation and aid customization; discussion and analysis of data sources not publicly available, and associated issues of privacy and copyright.
* __Modeling__: New pretraining, fine-tuning, inference methods for customizing NLP models; customizing reward models and model alignment to diverse consumers. New modeling paradigms aimed at customization such as model ensembles, model averaging, federated learning, nonparametric models, etc.; customizing models at inference time via prompting, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, etc.
* __Evaluation__: Evaluation of existing generalist, non-customized models, identifying their shortcomings for varied use-cases; evaluation of customization techniques and customized models; interpretability and analysis of customization patterns across different kinds of consumers.
* __Open Science__: Best practices for open and reproducible science concerning customizable NLP: dataset release and licensing, open-sourcing models, related privacy, copyright, and policy issues.
* __Applications__: e.g., information seeking on sensitive data comprising legal, medical, or financial information; NLP models for communities reflecting sociolects, dialects, or other language varieties; personalized AI assistants, etc.
* __Ethical Issues__: privacy and copyright; personalization, intrusiveness, unintended biases; invisibility versus hypervisibility. -->

### Guidelines

TBD
<!-- * Our author guidelines follow the ARR requirements unless otherwise specified. 
* Paper submission is hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2024/Workshop/CustomNLP4U&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)#tab-your-consoles).
* We welcome both short (__up to 4 pages__) and long papers (__up to 8 pages__), not including references or appendix. 
  * Please use the provided LaTex template ([Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)) for your submission. Please follow the paper formatting guidelines general to “*ACL” conferences as specified in the style files. Authors may not modify the style files or use templates designed for other conferences.
  * The paper should be anonymized and uploaded to OpenReview as a single PDF. 
  * You may use as many pages of references and appendix as you wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix. 
  * Posting papers on preprint servers like ArXiv is permitted.
  * We encourage each submission to discuss the ethical and societal implications of their work, wherever applicable. 

* This workshop offers both archival and non-archival options for submissions. Archival papers will be indexed with proceedings, while non-archival submissions will not.
* The review process will be double-blind. -->
